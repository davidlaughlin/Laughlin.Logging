Laughlin.Logging
================

Sample logger wrapper to allow for swapping out logging implementation with minimal impact on the rest of the application code.

This solution includes three projects:

 * Laughlin.Logging - core logging wrapper implementation
 * Laughlin.Logging.Tests - unit test project
 * Laughlin.Logging.Console - interactive test project

Currently only a sample wrapper for Log4Net is included along with extension methods
